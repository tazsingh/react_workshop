# React Workshop - Jan 10th, 2017

### Objective

To take an imperative API and transform it to a declarative React API.

### Results

We took Leaflet's API and transformed its `Map` and `Marker` modules into React Components to create a more React friendly API.

## Get Started

Clone the repo and run:

```js
yarn
```

Then you can run:

```js
yarn start
```

And go to [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

## Extra bonus audience task

To take the `Marker` API and create it for `Polygon`s with nested `Point`s.
Presented use of `context` in order to reduce the need to keep passing the `map` `prop` down.
